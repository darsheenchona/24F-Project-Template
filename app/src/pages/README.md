# `pages` Folder

This folder contains all the pages that will be part of the application. Details on required numbers will be provided in the Phase 3 documentation.

These pages are meant to show you an example of some of the features of Streamlit and the way we will limit functionality access by role/persona. It is not meant to represent a complete application.

TODO: Describe the pages folder and include link to documentation. Don't forget about ordering of pages.

# Pages Directory Overview

This folder contains all the Streamlit pages that are part of the application. These pages serve as examples of features available in the application and demonstrate how functionality is restricted based on role or persona. They are **not** meant to represent a full application but provide foundational components to showcase expected workflows and functionality.

The application is modularized into various pages for distinct user roles such as **Student**, **Co-op Advisor**, **Recruiter**, and **IT Service Head**, with routing and access logic configured accordingly.
